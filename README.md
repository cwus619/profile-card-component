- Live Site URL: (https://cwus619.github.io/profile-card-component/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used a desktop-first approach when building the page, and then adapted the result to a smaller, mobile screen.

Some of the most important things I learnt in putting the page together was making use of the "position" attribute in CSS, and how these relate to one another. Of particular
interest was the use of z-index in positioning the background images. Similarly, making use of the different position options to place the profile photo in the correct place relative to the banner at the top of the card.


### Continued development

Going forward, I'll be continuing to work on my flexbox skills, as well as other methods for laying out the webpage (for example, I'm yet to attempt CSS Grid). 

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This helped me massively in making sense of the position and z-index attributes.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I have been making use of css-tricks for several projects recently to review and better understand how flexbox works - I find the guide very intuitive with its visual aids.
